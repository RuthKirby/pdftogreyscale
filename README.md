# Pdf to GrayScale
Inspired by - https://tonyjunkes.com/blog/formatting-a-color-pdf-to-grayscale/
## Introduction

Will change a colour PDF into greyscale or black and white by changing each page into a 
monochrome/greyscale image then converting back into a PDF. 

## Instructions 
In the Main.class change the PdfToGrey.pdfToImage method parameter to the pathway 
of the colour PDF you want to change to greyscale (shades of grey)/Binary (black and white). Perhaps
the location of the PDF could be the resources folder.

Also change the boolean in the method call to be true if you want the new PDF to be pure black and
white, or leave as false if you want it to be greyscale (shades of grey)

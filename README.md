# Pdf to GrayScale
Inspired by - https://tonyjunkes.com/blog/formatting-a-color-pdf-to-grayscale/
## Introduction

Will change a colour PDF into greyscale or black and white by changing each page into a 
monochrome/greyscale image then converting back into a PDF. 

## Instructions 
In the Main.class change the PdfToGrey.pdfToImage method parameter to the pathway 
of the colour PDF you want to change to greyscale. Perhaps
the location of the PDF could be the resources folder.
